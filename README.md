# Keyboard Text Player

A browser-based interface for midi files based on piano sheets into a computer keyboard based instrument. Open a text file generated by `convert.py` from a midi, then step through the piece playing along with your keyboard or on autoplay with highlighted tokens, adjustable tempo, transpose controls, and a responsive on-screen piano.

## Features
- **Convert Midi files**  can play a mifi file from pretty much any reasonable piano sheet using the `.txt` produced by `convert.py`.
- **Tempo & transpose**  set BPM, shift the key, and reset instantly.
- **Visual guidance**  highlighted tokens, duration subscripts and a piano display keep you oriented as you play.
- **Auto-play & practice**  let the computer player step through the chart or use your own keyboard to match the target notes.

## Getting Started
1. Run `convert.py` on a MIDI file to produce the textual chart. The input file should be named input.midi and the output will be output.txt but you can change it in the script:
   ```bash
   python convert.py 
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Choose the generated `output.txt`, adjust settings, and start practicing.
